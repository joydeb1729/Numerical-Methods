# Gaussian Elimination Solver for 3x3 System of Equations

This C++ program solves a system of three linear equations with three unknowns using Gaussian Elimination. The program accepts input equations in the format `a1x1 + b1x2 + c1x3 = d1` and performs forward elimination followed by back substitution to compute the values of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`.

## Features

- Parses linear equations in the form `ax1 + bx2 + cx3 = d`.
- Uses Gaussian elimination to find the solution.
- Handles floating-point coefficients and constants.

## Input Format

The equations must follow the format:
