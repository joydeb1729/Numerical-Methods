# Bisection Method for Root Finding

## Description
The Bisection Method is a numerical technique used to find the roots of continuous functions. It is particularly useful when the function changes sign over an interval, indicating the presence of a root.

## Theory
The Bisection Method operates on the principle that if a continuous function $f(x)$ changes sign between two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ (i.e., $f(x_1) \cdot f(x_2) < 0$), there exists at least one root in the interval $[x_1, x_2]$ due to the Intermediate Value Theorem.

### Steps of the Bisection Method:
1. **Initial Setup:** Choose two initial points $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that $f(x_1) \cdot f(x_2) < 0$.
2. **Iteration:**
   - Calculate the midpoint $x_0 = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}$.
   - Evaluate the function at the midpoint: $f(x_0)$.
   - If $f(x_0)$ is sufficiently close to zero (within a specified tolerance), then $x_0$ is the root.
   - If $f(x_0)$ and $f(x_1)$ have opposite signs, set $x_2 = x_0$; otherwise, set $x_1 = x_0$.
3. **Repeat** the process until the desired accuracy is achieved or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

### Convergence
The Bisection Method guarantees convergence to a root, provided that the initial interval is chosen correctly. The methodâ€™s convergence rate is linear, meaning the number of correct digits approximately doubles with each iteration.

### Limitations
- Requires that the function is continuous on the interval $[x_1, x_2]$.
- Slower than other methods (like Newton-Raphson) for finding roots due to its linear convergence rate.

## Conclusion
The Bisection Method is a foundational algorithm in numerical analysis, offering a reliable way to approximate roots of functions. It is particularly advantageous for functions where other methods may fail or where a guaranteed root-finding process is desired.
